<h2>Eulerian vs. Lagrangian Simulations</h2>
The types of physical simulations we do in compute graphics, visual effects,
animation and games can be very coarsely categorized as either "Eulerian" or
"Lagrangian". In simple terms, Eulerian Simulations are ones where the 
locations in space at which the simulation is being performed do not move, 
though mass may pass through these points. In our simple state examples, the
water height field is an Eulerian simulation - it has a grid, with a height
at each point, and every time we draw the grid we draw each rectangle in the
same horizontal location - the waves will move through the sim points, even
as the sim points stay in place. The shorthand is "Eulerian = Grids"
<p>
By contrast, a Lagrangian simulation is one in which the physical locations
at which the sim is calculated (and at which knowledge about the system 
resides) move with the simulation as it is calculated. So, basically, a particle
system, in which the particle locations change from frame to frame, and the
physics are performed by looking at the relationships between the particles. The
shorthand is "Lagrangian = Particles".
<p>
Finally, "Hybrid" simulations are ones which use both moving and fixed elements,
such as using particles and grids simultaneously. The Particle-Level-Set methods
are good examples of a hybrid system, as is the popular "Flip" fluid simulation
method.
<h2>An Eulerian Smoke Grid</h2>
We're going to create an Eulerian Grid simulation of smoke, in which a 2D
grid of cells will contain velocities and densities. Just like in the 
simple state example where we aggregated our state, we'll create a single
state object and use integer pointers to access different parts of it.
<p>
Smoke will require current and previous values for velocity and density,
arrays to hold input data gathered from the mouse, and finally some scratch
space to use while calculating. Here's what it looks like - it's not much
different from our simple state example:
<p>
<pre><code>

// Grid resolution per side. Rectangular
int NX = 62;
int NY = 62;

// The size of the sim, in "world" units.
float LX = 100.0;

// Size, in "world" units, of a grid cell.
// Our cells are uniform (square) so DX & DY are the same.
float DXY = LX / ( float )NX;

// Y size, keeping square cells.
float LY = DXY * ( float )NY;

// The size of each grid cell, in pixels.
// This is for drawing
int CellPixels = 8;

// The length of all of our (one-dimensional)
// arrays. We use 1d arrays rather than matrices
// mostly for efficiency reasons.
int GridArraySize = GX*GY;

// Our State Arrays
int NUM_ARRAYS = 12;
float[][] State = new float[NUM_ARRAYS][GridArraySize];
int GridPrevU = 0;
int GridU = 1;
int GridPrevV = 2;
int GridV = 3;
int GridPrevDensity = 4;
int GridDensity = 5;
int GridInputU = 6;
int GridInputV = 7;
int GridInputDensity = 8;
int GridTemp0 = 9;
int GridTemp1 = 10;
int GridTemp2 = 11;

float VstrokeAlpha = 0.5;
</code></pre>

That's all for now!
