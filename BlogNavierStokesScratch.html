Though air and smoke are compressible, and have
variable density, we'll model our fluid as an incompressible fluid for simplicity.
This gives us our first equation of state, that density, written using the greek
letter \(\rho\), is constant, and we'll simplify life by just setting it equal
to 1.
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \rho = constant = 1
    \label{eq:ConstantDensity}
    \end{equation}

<h2>Fluid Equations of Motion</h2>
To derive the equations of motion for a fluid, we'll follow the steps described
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> in
the classic <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.info/">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>,
Book II, Chapter 40 ("The Flow of Dry Water").
<h3>Fluid Velocity</h3>
Firstly, we must consider what
we're simulating and how to represent it in our State. For a homogeneous,
incompressible fluid without an interface to a second fluid (called a free surface),
the main property of the fluid that we are simulating is its velocity. This makes intuitive sense -  when we think of "fluidity", we think of smooth, stream-like motion that changes in curvy ways over time. (Or at least I do).
So, let's start with a simple state that's reminiscent of the previous
2D Wave Equation:
<p>
The equations of motion for an incompressible fluid (ignoring temperature and
magnetic effects) say, simply, "Mass and Momentum are Conserved". We'll do
a little bit of derivation here, just to understand the nature of the terms, but
our primary concern is in translating the equations into a simulation engine, and
there are ample resources for working through these derivations on your own.
Let's look first at the "Momentum Is Conserved" part.
<h3>Hydrodynamic Equation of Motion</h3>
Newton's second law says that mass times acceleration is equal to force. For a
fluid, let us consider a fixed volume of the space which the fluid occupies - in
our case, each "cell" of our 2D array (or grid) represents a small square with
a fixed area - or in 3D, a volume. Let \(\mathbf{f}\) represent the
<i>force density</i>, that is, the force per unit volume, a continuously varying
field in space and time. Density, \(\rho\), is defined as the mass per unit
volume, so we can derive Newton's second law for fluids as:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{eqnarray}
    mass \times (acceleration) &=& force \label{eq:NewtonsSecondLaw} \\
    mass &=& \rho \times volume \label{eq:DensityDefinition} \\
    force &=& \mathbf{f} \times volume \label{eq:ForceDensityDefinition} \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    \]
    \[
    \text{(substitute \eqref{eq:DensityDefinition} and \eqref{eq:ForceDensityDefinition}
    into \eqref{eq:NewtonsSecondLaw})}
    \]
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \rho \times volume \times (acceleration) = \mathbf{f} \times volume
    \end{equation}
    \]
    \[
    \text{(cancel out volume on both sides)}
    \]
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \rho \times (acceleration) = \mathbf{f}
    \label{eq:NewtonsSecondLawFluid}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
The force density is made up of three parts. First, there's the pressure force
per unit volume, which is defined as \(\mathbf{f}_{pres} = -\nabla p\),
where \(p\) is the scalar pressure field. Second, there's the external forces,
such as gravity, which are defined in terms of a potential field, \(\phi\). In
the simple case of gravity only, we can simply say
\(\mathbf{f}_{ext} = \rho \mathbf{g}\), where \(\mathbf{g}\) is the gravitational
acceleration vector. Lastly there's the viscosity force \(\mathbf{f}_{visc}\),
which is defined as \(\mathbf{f}_{visc} = \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}\). We will
delve into viscosity in a later class. So, in summary:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{f}_{pres} &=& -\nabla p \\
    \mathbf{f}_{visc} &=& \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} \\
    \mathbf{f}_{ext} &=& \rho \mathbf{g} \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    \]
    \[
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbf{f} &=& \mathbf{f}_{pres} + \mathbf{f}_{visc} + \mathbf{f}_{ext} \\
    \mathbf{f} &=& -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
    \label{eq:ForceDensityExpanded} \\
    \end{eqnarray}
    \]
</div>
The only thing that's left is the acceleration term. This is tricker than it
seems! The obvious thing to do would be to say that acceleration equals
\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}\). However, this is not correct, for
subtle reasons.  We're simulating our fluid on a computation grid (our state
array cells) that is defined at fixed locations in space. The individual particles
of fluid are moving through those locations, and so we have to take the motion
of the fluid into account when computing acceleration. This is called the "material
derivative" of velocity, written \(\frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t}\). There's a detailed
derivation in Chapter 40 of the
<a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.info/">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>, which
we'll skip to the end of:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = v_x \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial x} +
        v_y \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial y} +
        v_z \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial z} +
        \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
    \label{eq:MaterialDerivativeBigD}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
There's a symbolic notation for the summed spatial partial derivatives above,
called the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advection#The_advection_equation">
Advection Operator</a>, \((\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\):
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} =
        v_x \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial x} +
        v_y \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial y} +
        v_z \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial z}
    \label{eq:AdvectionOperatorVelocity}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
Which allows us to describe the fluid acceleration:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    acceleration = (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{v} +
        \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}
    \label{eq:FluidAcceleration}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
Substituting \(\eqref{eq:ForceDensityExpanded}\) and
\(\eqref{eq:FluidAcceleration}\) into \(\eqref{eq:NewtonsSecondLawFluid}\), we
arrive (finally) at the momentum equation for a fluid:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \rho (\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} +
            \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}) =
            -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
    \label{eq:NavierStokesMomentum}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>

state of the fluid is entirely Firstly, we'll describe the
conservation of mass for a fluid.
at the beginning of the class. Our state will be a vector of 2D arrays, as in the 2D Wave Equation
example. Each cell will contain a scalar representing the amount of smoke,
as well as a velocity in the x & y directions. We'll also have a pressure field,
and we'll require some additional fields to complete the picture.  The solver
in its final form will be a solution to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow_of_Newtonian_fluids">Incompressible Navier Stokes Equations</a> in 2D, which can be written as follows:
<p>
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \rho (\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} +
            \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}) =
            -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}
    \label{eq:NavierStokesMomentum2}
    \end{equation}
    \]\[
    \begin{equation}
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0
    \label{eq:NavierStokesContinuity}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
The first of these two equations, \(\eqref{eq:NavierStokesMomentum}\) is called
the Momentum Equation, and the second, \(\eqref{eq:NavierStokesContinuity}\)
is called the Continuity Equation. To start with, we'll focus on the first
part of the momentum equation, \(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} +
            \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}\), which represents the acceleration
of the fluid velocity and the motion of the fluid mass through the spatial
locations represented by the simulation grid cells.  We can temporarily discard
all the other parts of the momentum equation and just consider the simpler equation:
<div class="LaTexEquation">
    \[
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} +
            \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} = 0
    \label{eq:Advection}
    \end{equation}
    \]
</div>
Though smoke and air are not incompressible, we'll treat them as an incompressible
fluid for the purposes of this exploration, which means the density \(\rho\) is
constant in the equations. To represent smoke visually, we'll use an "ink density"
scalar that we advect through the fluid, but otherwise does not affect the physics
of the simulation.
