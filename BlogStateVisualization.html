<h2>Visualizing the Simulation State</h2>
Once we've established the state vector for our system, the very first thing
that a simulation designer should do is to establish a visualization method
for as many parts of the simulation state as possible.  The better the 
visualization tools, the better the simulation, and the less time you will
spend tracking down bugs or chasing misbehaving physics.  
<p>
In fact, good visualization tools will allow you to learn and understand 
how your simulation is working at a deep level, and you'll begin to establish
an intuitive relationship with the measurements that form your simulation state.

<h2>Drawing the Pendulum</h2>
The first thing we do when preparing to draw is to define a transformation
from the simulation coordinate system to the viewing coordinate system. This
is a standard part of graphics pipelines and will be familiar to anyone
who has used OpenGL - we're essentially defining the transformation and 
projection matrices.

In our pendulum case (and indeed in many of our examples), we simply need to
define a relationship between the working units of the sim, in this case
meters, and the pixels of the display. We define these variables in the
header:

<pre><code>
int WindowWidthHeight = 300;
float WorldSize = 2.0;
float PixelsPerMeter;
float OriginPixelsX;
float OriginPixelsY;
</code></pre>
and then in the setup function, we calculate their values. In this case 
I'm explicitly deciding to put the origin at the midpoint in X, and a quarter
of the way down in Y.
<pre><code>
PixelsPerMeter = (( float )WindowWidthHeight ) / WorldSize;
OriginPixelsX = 0.5 * ( float )WindowWidthHeight;
OriginPixelsY = 0.25 * ( float )WindowWidthHeight;
</code></pre>
It is typical to try to construct viewing transformation, such as scaling 
and translating the view, independently of modeling transformations. However,
processing.js has a bug with concatenated transformations, so unfortunately
our code has to accomodate the transformation from sim coordinates in meters
to pixel coordinates by itself.
<p>
We define a DrawState function that we call from processing's 'draw' function,
and draw the elements of our state. In this case we have a pendulum arm, a
pendulum bob (the weight at the end), and the pivot point at the base of the
pendulum. We use the angle of the pendulum from the state to determine the
endpoint of the arm for drawing, thus visualizing our state:
<pre><code>
// The DrawState function assumes that the coordinate space is that of the
// simulation - namely, meters, with the pendulum pivot placed at the origin.
// Draw the arm, pivot, and bob!
// There is currently a bug in processing.js which requires us to do the
// pixels-per-meter scaling ourselves.
void DrawState()
{
    // Compute end of arm.
    float ArmEndX = PixelsPerMeter * PendulumLength * sin( StatePendulumTheta );
    float ArmEndY = PixelsPerMeter * PendulumLength * cos( StatePendulumTheta );
  
    // Draw the pendulum arm.
    strokeWeight( 1.0 );
    line( 0.0, 0.0, ArmEndX, ArmEndY );
          
    // Draw the pendulum pivot
    fill( 0.0 );
    ellipse( 0.0, 0.0, 
             PixelsPerMeter * 0.03, 
             PixelsPerMeter * 0.03 );
    
    // Draw the pendulum bob
    fill( 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 );
    ellipse( ArmEndX, ArmEndY, 
             PixelsPerMeter * 0.1, 
             PixelsPerMeter * 0.1 );
}
</code></pre>

And that's all we need to display the state our our simple pendulum 
simulation! Here it is running in processing.  Note that there's no movement
yet, as we haven't added any time integration into the code - we've just
defined our state vector and a display mechanism for it.
